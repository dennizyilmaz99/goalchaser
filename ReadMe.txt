◦ Write about what the project is all about and introduce it to the reader.

My project is an simple TODO/Goal Motivation app. It's all about accomplishment when you are done with something and it's important that you write it up so you can have it in mind all
day so you can accomplish it. 
So what you can do in my app is write down your goals and see for each day what you're supposed to do.  
You can see how many goals you have for both today and tomorrow. 
You can also turn on dark mode so it will be more friendly to your eyes. You can also log in or register an account that will be saved to my database. 

◦ Provide an ordered list of components (top-down or bottom-up) in your project; like my
main component app has component a, b and c. component a and b have d while
component c has e, f and g.

It starts with my App.js where all the functionality is based such as Navigator and screens and context providers. 
Then I have GoalToday, GoalTomorrow, LifeTimeGoals, LogInScreen, Settings and HomeScreen. 
These are my screens in the app. I do also have a component folder where my createContext is based. 
My theme folder is my themeContext and the theme file where the colors switch back and 
fourth based on the switch value in my settings file. Last but not least i have my database folder where my Firebase is based. 


◦ Briefly write about the styling, design decisions, libraries that you’ve used (if any) and
the APIs / concepts that we’ve been through in this course such as context, navigator,
modal etc.

I have chosen a stylish style to my app. Something simple with a simple text and shadows. 
I'm like a apple person so stylish is my word to my design. I did not use any libraries or APIs for
this project. I did use components that we've been through in this course, such as navigator, context, useEffect etc and of course useState.
